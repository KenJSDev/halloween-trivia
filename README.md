# Halloween Trivia
This project was created as an entry into the W3 Schools Halloween Coding Challenge in 2022. I won second place. 

### Languages / Protocols / Tools
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Visual Studio Code, Git Hub

### Project Details
- The initial build of this project focused heavily on media. I knew it was going to be a short trivia game that didn't have a lot of replay value. So I wanted to build something that users would play through only once or twice but have a good time doing so.
- To accomplish the above, I created a "good ending" and "bad ending" complete with a gif and sound queues. I also added a feedback system that provides immediate feedback, context, and audible confirmations.

## Focus Moving Forward
- Detect and resolve bugs
- Improve stability
- Enhnace the overall user experience
