# Halloween Trivia
I created this project in October of 2022 as part of a W3 Schools challenge which they promoted on Discord. This was my first completed project and it won second place. I was awarded 2 free courses on the platform.

### Project Details
- I didn't have a specific focus other than to do the best that I could to win the coding challenge
- I focused a lot on Grid view at the time, but will begin converting the application to flex box to enhance the mobile experience
- This project will continually be improved as I increase my knowledge and skillset
